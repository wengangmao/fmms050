# Spatio-temporal model

---

Statistical models are constructed due to internal correlation between the input features. Sometimes, the correlation can be in multi-dimensional, such as correlation in both multi-dimensional space and time. It is a small branch of applied statistics. We will present several concepts of this multi-dimensional correlation modelling and its applications for more advanced usage of statistical and machine learning. For this course, this part is optional.
