In this project, you are supposed to implement different machine learning algorithms for the modelling of a ship's performance. Then you can compare the cons/pros of different algorithms, as well as their parameters selection. The report should be composed of at least the following components:
* Background of the project 
* Methods used in the project
* Results of different methods
* Discussion/Comparison of different methods
* Conclusions
