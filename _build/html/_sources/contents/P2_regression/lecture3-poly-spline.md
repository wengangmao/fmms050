* Polynomial regression
* Spline regression/fitting (different from interpolation)
* Model estimation and evaluation of goodness
- Cost/loss functions: penalties and regularization
- Significant test and confidence interval (more complex model does not mean better model)
- ANOVA, MSE and R2
* Advises when apply statistical and machine learning for modelling
