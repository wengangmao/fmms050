# Basic mathematics and statistics for machine learning methods

+++
---

Machine learning methods have some roots connected with basic knowledge on mathematics and statistics. In order to understand the basic concepts/knowledgee, you need to have some basic knowledge on mathematics and statistics. While if you are only interested in how to use machine learning packages, you may not need to have very deep knowledge on those mathematics.

In this part, we will give some fundamental knowledge on basic mathematicas and statistics. More importantly, for those who are interested in digging deep in different machine learning methods, we will also provide some references for you to study a bit advanced mathematics and statistics.
