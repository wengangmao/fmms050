## Eligibility
Doctoral students and senior master students at Chalmers
## Course specific prerequisites
Mathematics (including mathematical statistics, linear algebra, numerical analysis and multi-variable calculus), mechanics and strength of materials and engineering materials. Applicants should have the need to deal with some experimental or full-scale data from engineering mechanics.

## Aim and objectives
The purpose of the course is to give statistical and machine learning methods to deal with experimental and full-scale test data from engineering mechanics, in order to understand the hidden characteristics within the data. In this course, the so-called data will cover two types, i.e., independent observations from multi-variables with uncertainties/noises, and strongly dependent observations of time series signals. In addition to the direct implementation skills of these methods for practical applications, this course also aims at teaching some fundamental theory connected to each method.  
Learning outcomes 
After finishing the course, the student will have professional knowledge in the interpretation of various random nature involved engineering problems and application of various statistical and machine learning methods to model and explain engineering scenarios containing uncertainties.
